        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Mongolian beef recipe with green onions has a soy-based sauce for a Chinese-style beef dish. Best served over soft rice noodles or rice.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon grated fresh ginger root</li>
            <li>⅔ cup dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>1 pound beef flank steak, sliced 1/4 inch thick on the diagonal</li>
            <li>¼ cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>2 bunches green onions, cut in 2-inch lengths</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and ginger; cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in brown sugar, soy sauce, and water. Increase heat to medium-high; stir until sauce boils and slightly thickens, about 4 minutes. Remove sauce from the heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Place beef into a large bowl; add cornstarch and mix until beef is thoroughly coated. Set aside until most of the cornstarch has been absorbed, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Shake excess cornstarch from beef slices and drop into hot oil, a few at a time, stirring briefly and frying until edges become crisp, about 2 minutes. Remove beef with a large slotted spoon; drain on paper towels.</li>
            <li>Remove excess oil from the skillet, then heat the skillet over medium heat; add beef slices and stir in prepared sauce. Add green onions and bring to a boil; cook until the onions have just softened and are bright green, about 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
